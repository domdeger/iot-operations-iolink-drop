  "Title": "Azure IoT Operations Sample - IOLink.NET via MQTT",
  "Summary": "This sample demonstrates the integration of IO-Link devices using IOLink.NET to connect with the integrated Azure IoT Operations MQTT Broker.",
  "Description": "This code sample shows how to integrate IO-Link sensor data with an Azure IoT Operations MQTT Broker. The application uses IOLink.NET to connect to an IO-Link Master and read sensor data with the IOLinkPortReader. The data is then published periodically as MQTT messages. Containerization with Docker ensures easy deployment and scalability. Requirements include .NET 8+, Docker, an MQTT broker, and an IO-Link Master with connected sensors. Configuration is managed via the appsettings.json file and can be overridden by environment variables.",
